# GOV94

Clean up instructions:

Replace quotiation marks with single space.
Replace apostrophes with single space.
Can remove em or en dashes if desired (replace with single space).
DO NOT remove/replace periods, commas, or regular dashes.

Saving as .txt should reduce number of weird characters in files.
